# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. Goal was to create a library coffeeshop site using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Adding a function where you can preplace a order for the table you booked would be helpful in the long run.
